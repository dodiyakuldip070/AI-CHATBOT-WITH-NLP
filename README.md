INTERN ID: CT12WNBT

DOMAIN: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

BATCH DURATION: JANUARY 25TH,2025 TO APRIL 25TH,2025

MENTOR NAME: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

# DESCRIPTION: 
This Python program implements a simple chatbot named RUMI using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk). It utilizes the nltk.chat.util module to create a rule-based chatbot that responds to predefined user inputs. The chatbot is designed to provide an engaging conversational experience with a philosophical tone.

The Chat class is used to define response patterns, where specific user inputs are mapped to predefined responses. The chatbot recognizes greetings, inquiries about its name and abilities, and farewell messages. It also provides a fallback response for unrecognized inputs, encouraging users to rephrase their queries.

The script defines a function chatbot_conversation() that initiates a loop for user interaction. The conversation continues until the user inputs "Bye" or "Goodbye", at which point the chatbot responds with a farewell message and exits. The nltk.download('punkt') command ensures tokenization support for processing text.

This chatbot is built using Python and NLTK, a powerful library for natural language processing (NLP). It demonstrates the use of pattern matching and reflection-based response generation. This project serves as a foundational example of chatbot development, useful for beginners in NLP and AI-driven conversations.
